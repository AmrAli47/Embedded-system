The Door Lock Controller Project utilizes a PIC MCU, LCD, keypad, L298N motor driver, and motor to create a secure access system. Users enter a password via the keypad, which is then displayed on the LCD. If the entered password is correct, the motor activates; if incorrect, the system prompts the user to try again.
