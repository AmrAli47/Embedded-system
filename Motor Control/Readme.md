The Motor Control Project employs a PIC MCU and LM35 temperature sensor to monitor ambient temperature and control motor direction accordingly. The MCU processes the temperature readings, displaying the current value on an LCD. Based on predefined temperature thresholds, the L298N motor driver is activated to adjust the motorâ€™s direction.
