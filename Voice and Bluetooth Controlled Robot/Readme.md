### Components: Arduino UNO, L298N, Motors, HC-05 Bluetooth Module.
### Project Description :

### The Arduino Wireless Voice Controlled Robot consists of a transmitter and a receiver section. 
### The transmitter end consists of Smartphone Bluetooth and the Android app installed on it. 
### The Receiver section has Arduino board, HC-05 Bluetooth Module as a 
### wireless communication module, L298N for driving motors.
### Establish the connection of Bluetooth module and the Android Application. 
### Once connected, give predefined commands through the mobile handset to the robot.

### Commands are:
Forward: Activates both motors at slow speed and moves it forward.
Backward: Activates both motors at slow speed and moves it backward. 
Fast Forward: Activates both motors at full speed and moves it fast forward. 
Fast Backward: Activates both motors at full speed and moves it backward. 
Slow Right: Activates left motor and makes a left turn.  
Slow Left: Activates right motor and makes a right turn.  
Stop: Deactivates both motors.
